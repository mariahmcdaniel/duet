  ## Description
 Duet is a new way to connect with people across the world through a love of common music interests or a pursuit of those who have opposite views. As a collaborate effort, Duet was formed using a MERN fullstack approach and is deployed to Heroku for the greater world to enjoy. Using different models and criteria, Users can match with those who they are interested in if they have also been matched by that other user. Profiles allow songs chosen to be actively sampled to provide a glimpse of a person's personality.
    
  ## Usage
When a User opens the site they will be offered a chance to login or sign up for a new account. When a user opens a new account they will enter some personal information and then presented with a series of questions that allow them to answer with song titles that represent their answer. These questions are specific and a bit quarky, this lets your personality really shine out with your choice. When the profile is built, other users can search through lists of profiles and see what songs they chose, even sample the songs too! If a person is interested they can match with other users and if the other also connects, a match is made and added to the profiles. This is so you can connect, be it romantic or friendly, you can now get to know someone new.
